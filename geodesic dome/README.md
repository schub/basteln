Geodesic Dome
=============

The aim of this project is to build printable 3d models of connectors for a 3V geodesic dome.

Please see the file ```/scad/connectors.scad```. It contains all information for generating connectors of a dome. Adjust values in the parameters section to your needs. A connector consists of two parts (top and bottom). For each part there is a module ```top(config)``` and ```bottom(config)```. The file defines ```config```s for connectors you need to build a 3V 5/8 dome. You need rods of 3 different lengths (represented by **A**, **B** and **C**). Please see this website for more information: http://www.domerama.com/calculators/
