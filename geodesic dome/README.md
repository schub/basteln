Geodesic Dome
=============

The aim of this project is to build printable 3d models of connectors for a 3V geodesic dome.

Please see the file ```/scad/connectors.scad```. It contains all information for generating connectors of 3V 5/8 dome. Adjust values in the parameters section to your needs.

When building a 3V dome, you need rods of 3 different lengths (represented by **A**, **B** and **C**). Please see this website for more information: http://www.domerama.com/calculators/
